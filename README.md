## Deliverables

### A poem of space

* Due 3 Februrary 2020 by the start of class (1:30 PM)

**Note**: If making a physical drawing, I require both the drawing and images of it placed in the `writing` directory

- [ ] A drawing or other graphical representation of the "space" of the poem chosen
    * Your image (of any type) must be:
        * Named `plot` 
        * placed in the `studies` folder
- [ ] A response or notional description of the space in the form of a poem
    * Your poem must take a line or phrase from a critical text we've read this semester so far
    * Your poem's first line must be a line from the poem to which you're responding
    * Place this response in the `writing` directory's `poem.md` file _or_ place an image (of any type) named `poem` in the `writing` folder
    
Keep in mind that the word "poem" here can take many different meanings; reflect on the examples presented in the week's slide presentation for alternate ways into poetry.
