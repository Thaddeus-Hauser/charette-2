A Child's Quest

Before “he is cast into the world”, as claimed by certain hasty metaphysics, 
man is laid in the cradle of the house: encrust with years of 
clammy grime, the lair, maybe, sees you too, an air of
pressure pulls you down, past the pickles on the left and 
through those hidden treasured chests.

A wave of fire glints inside the eyes 
of the demented furnance of the house 
a sputtering dragon ready to pounce
and you, the mouse.
